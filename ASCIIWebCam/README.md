#ASCII Web Cam
This is a light front-end that translates the user's web cam feed into ASCII text. The text is selectable and can be copied.
Note, for best results, stick to single-byte characters when modifying the color ramp.
The feed is captured at 640x480 pixels and then downsampled to approximate 10x16 pixels of coverage per character.
##UI Features:
* Change Text (Foreground) and Background colors
* Change the characters used by the color ramp.
* Pause and restart the video processing for easy selection or copying
